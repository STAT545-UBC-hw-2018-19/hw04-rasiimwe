## Data Reshaping Prompt (and relationship to aggregation) 
Overview: Problem - You have data in one “shape” but you wish it were in another. Usually this is because the alternative shape is superior for presenting a table, making a figure, or doing aggregation and statistical analysis. 
          Solution: Reshape your data. For simple reshaping, gather() and spread() from tidyr will suffice. 

The dplyr library as a major component of the data analysis ecosystem.

### Activity #2
> Make a tibble with one row per year and columns for life expectancy for two or more countries.
> Use knitr::kable() to make this table look pretty in your rendered homework.
> Take advantage of this new data shape to scatterplot life expectancy for one country against that of another.

### Loading required packages for this assignment

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse)) 
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gapminder))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(knitr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(cowplot))


```
### Make a tibble with one row per year and columns for life expectancy for two or more countries.

```{r}
countries <- c("Cambodia", "Bulgaria","Malawi", "Kuwait")

life_expectancy <- gapminder %>%
  filter(country %in% countries) %>%
  select(country, year, lifeExp) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  spread(key = country, value = lifeExp)
```


### Use knitr::kable() to make this table look pretty in your rendered homework.

```{r}

kable(life_expectancy)

```

### Take advantage of this new data shape to scatterplot life expectancy for one country against that of another.

```{r}

 CambodiaVsBulgaria<- life_expectancy %>%
  ggplot(aes(Cambodia, Bulgaria)) +
  geom_point() + ggtitle("Life Expectancy") + theme_gray()+
  labs(title="Life Expectancy CambodiaVsBulgaria",x="life_expectancy of Cambodia", y="life_expectancy of Bulgaria")

 KuwaitVsMalawi<- life_expectancy %>%
  ggplot(aes(Kuwait, Malawi)) +
  geom_point() + ggtitle("Life Expectancy") + theme_gray()+
labs(title="Life Expectancy KuwaitVsMalawi ",x="life_expectancy of Kuwait", y="life_expectancy of Malawi")

plot_grid(CambodiaVsBulgaria,  KuwaitVsMalawi, nrow=1, ncol = 2)
```


## Join Prompts (join, merge, look up)
Overview: Problem - You have two data sources and you need info from both in one new data object.
          Solution: Perform a join, which borrows terminology from the database world, specifically SQL.

### Activity #2 :Create your own cheatsheet 
> Create your own cheatsheet patterned after [Jenny’s](http://stat545.com/bit001_dplyr-cheatsheet.html) but focused on something you care about more than comics! Inspirational examples:
  + Pets I have owned + breed + friendly vs. unfriendly + ??. Join to a table of pet breed, including variables for furry vs not furry, mammal true or false, etc.
  + Movies and studios….
  + Athletes and teams….
You will likely need to iterate between your data prep and your joining to make your explorations comprehensive and interesting. For example, you will want a specific amount (or lack) of overlap between the two data.frames, in order to demonstrate all the different joins. You will want both the data frames to be as small as possible, while still retaining the expository value.

### Introduction to dplyr join functions

[<img align ="center" src="https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/join-venn.png" width="800" height="250"/>](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/join-venn.png)

Before we dig deeper into the various join functions, I will create the tibbles required to explore that application of these functions

### Creating tibble 1 
The idea and data used is derived from the wikipedia page of [preseidents of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States)

```{r}
presidents <- tibble(
  name = c("Donald Trump", "Barack Obama", "George W. Bush", "Bill Clinton","George H. W. Bush", "Ronald Reagan", "Jimmy Carter","Gerald Ford", "Richard Nixon"),
  previous_office = c("Chairman of The Trump Organization", "U.S. Senator from Illinois", "Governor of Texas", "Governor of Arkansas","Vice President of the United States", "Governor of California", "Governor of Georgia","Vice President of the United States", "Vice President of the United States"),
  party=c("Republican", "Democratic", "Republican", "Democratic","Republican", "Republican", "Democratic","Republican", "Republican"),
  in_office=c(2007, 2009, 2001, 1993,1989, 1981, 1977,1974, 1969),
  out_office=c("Incumbent", 2017, 2009, 2001,1993, 1989, 1981,1977, 1974)
)
```


### Creating tibble 2
```{r}
parties <- tibble(
  party=c("Republican", "Democratic", "Republican", "Democratic","Republican", "Republican", "Democratic","Republican", "Republican"),
  vice = c("Mike Pence", "Joe Biden", "Dick Cheney", "Al Gore","Dan Quayle", "George H. W. Bush", "Walter Mondale","Nelson Rockefeller", "Gerald Ford")
)
  
```


## Mutating joins:

**Joining tibbles using mutating functions:**

  1. `left_join`
  2. `right_join`
  3. `inner_join` 
  4. `full_join`


### Left Join

[<img align ="center" src="https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/left-join.gif" width="400" height="300"/>](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/left-join.gif)

**Basic syntax:** `left_join(x, y): keep all x, drop unmatched y`

**Join Function:** 

left_join(x, y): Return all rows from x, and all columns from x and y. If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combination of the matches are returned. This is a mutating join.

#### left_join on presidents & parties

```{r}
left_join(presidents, parties)
```


### Right Join

[<img align ="center" src="https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/right-join.gif" width="400" height="300"/>](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/right-join.gif)

**Basic syntax:** `right_join(x, y): keep all y, drop unmatched x`

#### right_join on presidents & parties

```{r}
right_join(presidents, parties)
```


### Inner Join

[<img align ="center" src="https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/inner-join.gif" width="400" height="300"/>](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/inner-join.gif)

**Basic syntax:** `inner_join(x, y): keep only matching`

**Join Function:** 

inner_join(x, y): Return all rows from x where there are matching values in y, and all columns from x and y. If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combination of the matches are returned. This is a mutating join.

#### inner_join on presidents & parties

```{r}
inner_join(presidents, parties)
```

### Full Join

[<img align ="center" src="https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/full-join.gif" width="400" height="300"/>](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/full-join.gif)

**Basic syntax:** `full_join(x, y): keep everything`

**Join Function:** 

full_join(x, y): Return all rows and all columns from both x and y. Where there are not matching values, returns NA for the one missing. This is a mutating join.

#### full_join on presidents & parties

```{r}
full_join(presidents, parties)
```

## Filtering joins:

**Joining tibbles using filtering functions:** 

  1. `semi_join`
  2. `anti_join`

### Semi Join

[<img align ="center" src="https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/semi-join.gif" width="400" height="300"/>](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/semi-join.gif)

**Basic syntax:** `semi_join(x, y): return rows from x where there are matching values in y`

**Join Function:** 

semi_join(x, y): Return all rows from x where there are matching values in y, keeping just columns from x. A semi join differs from an inner join because an inner join will return one row of x for each matching row of y, where a semi join will never duplicate rows of x. This is a filtering join.


#### semi_join on presidents & parties

```{r}
semi_join(presidents, parties)
```


### Anti Join

[<img align ="center" src="https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/anti-join.gif" width="400" height="300"/>](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/anti-join.gif)

anti_join(x, y): Return all rows from x where there are not matching values in y, keeping just columns from x. This is a filtering join.

#### anti_join on presidents & parties

```{r}
anti_join(presidents, parties)
```

## Set Operations:

**Functions used for set operations on two tibbles:**

  1. `intersect`
  2. `union`
  3. `setdiff`

## Biding datasets:

  1. `bind_rows` 
  2. `bind cols`
