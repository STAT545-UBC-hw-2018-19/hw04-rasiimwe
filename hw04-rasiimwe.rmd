# STAT545 Homework 4: Data wrangling with data aggregation and data reshaping

Data analysis tasks involve 3 main components, `(1) Data Manipulation`, `(2) Data Cleaning` and `(3) Data Visualization`. In my previous assignments, I showed the [application of dply for data exploration and manipulation, followed by visualisation of the data using ggplot2.](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw03-rasiimwe/blob/master/hw03-rasiimwe.md). It is estimated that 80% of data analysis tasks are inclined to data manipulation and cleaning. This is attribtued to the growth in data sources that need preparation to efficiently handle this data 

## The dplyr library as a major component of the data analysis ecosystem. 

[<img align ="center" src="https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/dplyr.png" width="500" height="300"/>](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/dplyr.png)

Herein, I present **the application of the dplyr package in supporting data manipulation operations** for data anlysis. Here we shall focus on manipulating data using functions such as `gather()`, `spread()`, `mutating joins`, `filtering joins`, `set operations` and `biding` datasets. 

### Loading required packages

First, I will load all packages required for this assignment

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse)) 
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gapminder))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(knitr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(cowplot))
```

## Qn 1. Data Reshaping Prompt
Overview: Problem - You have data in one “shape” but you wish it were in another. Usually this is because the alternative shape is superior for presenting a table, making a figure, or doing aggregation and statistical analysis. 
          Solution: Reshape your data. For simple reshaping, gather() and spread() from tidyr will suffice. 

### Activity #2
> Make a tibble with one row per year and columns for life expectancy for two or more countries.
> Use knitr::kable() to make this table look pretty in your rendered homework.
> Take advantage of this new data shape to scatterplot life expectancy for one country against that of another.

### Make a tibble with one row per year and columns for life expectancy for two or more countries.

```{r}
countries <- c("Cambodia", "Bulgaria","Malawi", "Kuwait") #selecting countries for inclusion in my tibble

life_expectancy <- gapminder %>%
  filter(country %in% countries) %>% #filtering the gapminder dataset for the four countries in my vector countries
  select(country, year, lifeExp) %>% #selecting variable for inclusion in my tibble life_expectancy
  group_by(year) #choosing to group by year
  
kable(life_expectancy) #applying the kable function to render a neat/ nicely presented table
```

As we can see, the tibble is in long format but what we would like to have is a tibble with one row per year and columns for life expectancy for two or more countries. To do this, I apply the spread function as shown below.

```{r}
life_expectancy <- life_expectancy %>% 
  spread(key = country, value = lifeExp) #applying the spread function from dplyr to spread selected countries based on lifeExp (value) across the tibble columns
```

### Use knitr::kable() to make this table look pretty in your rendered homework.

Below I show a more tidy and usable tibble using the kable() function

```{r}

kable(life_expectancy)

```

As we can see above, our initial table that was in long format is now in wide and more tidy form to support the building of the required scatter plot for the subsequent section. 

### Take advantage of this new data shape to scatterplot life expectancy for one country against that of another.

```{r}
 CambodiaVsBulgaria<- life_expectancy %>%
  ggplot(aes(Cambodia, Bulgaria)) +
  geom_point() + ggtitle("Life Expectancy") + theme_gray()+
  labs(title="Life Expectancy CambodiaVsBulgaria",x="life_expectancy of Cambodia", y="life_expectancy of Bulgaria")

 KuwaitVsMalawi<- life_expectancy %>%
  ggplot(aes(Kuwait, Malawi)) +
  geom_point() + ggtitle("Life Expectancy") + theme_gray()+
labs(title="Life Expectancy KuwaitVsMalawi ",x="life_expectancy of Kuwait", y="life_expectancy of Malawi")

plot_grid(CambodiaVsBulgaria,  KuwaitVsMalawi, nrow=1, ncol = 2)
```

Above, we see scatter plots that have been build from the new transformed tibble (life_expectancy). The shapes that our data takes on may or may not support the kinds of analyses we need. In this case, we wouldnt have been able to create these plots had the data stayed in the long format which further goes to show for the need of data reshaping before futher analysis is done. It also helps to know which data formats support which type of analysis.

## Qn 2. Join Prompt 
Overview: Problem - You have two data sources and you need info from both in one new data object.
          Solution: Perform a join, which borrows terminology from the database world, specifically SQL.

### Activity #2 :Create your own cheatsheet 
> Create your own cheatsheet patterned after [Jenny’s](http://stat545.com/bit001_dplyr-cheatsheet.html) but focused on something you care about more than comics! Inspirational examples:
  + Pets I have owned + breed + friendly vs. unfriendly + ??. Join to a table of pet breed, including variables for furry vs not furry, mammal true or false, etc.
  + Movies and studios….
  + Athletes and teams….
You will likely need to iterate between your data prep and your joining to make your explorations comprehensive and interesting. For example, you will want a specific amount (or lack) of overlap between the two data.frames, in order to demonstrate all the different joins. You will want both the data frames to be as small as possible, while still retaining the expository value.

### Introduction to dplyr's join functions

[<img align ="center" src="https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/join-venn.png" width="800" height="250"/>](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/join-venn.png)

Before we dig deeper into the various join functions, I will create the tibbles required to explore that application of these functions

### Creating tibble 1 
The idea and data used is derived from the wikipedia page of [preseidents of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States)

```{r}
presidents <- tibble(
  name = c("Donald Trump", "Barack Obama", "George W. Bush", "Bill Clinton","George H. W. Bush", "Ronald Reagan", "Jimmy Carter","Gerald Ford", "Richard Nixon", "Rebecca Asiimwe"),
  previous_office = c("Chairman of The Trump Organization", "U.S. Senator from Illinois", "Governor of Texas", "Governor of Arkansas","Vice President of the United States", "Governor of California", "Governor of Georgia","Vice President of the United States", "Vice President of the United States", "Senior Bioinformatician BCCRC"),
  party=c("Republican", "Democratic", "Republican", "Democratic","Republican", "Republican", "Democratic","Republican", "Republican","Independent"),
  vice = c("Mike Pence", "Joe Biden", "Dick Cheney", "Al Gore","Dan Quayle", "George H. W. Bush", "Walter Mondale","Nelson Rockefeller", "Gerald Ford","Unknown"),
  in_office=c(2007, 2009, 2001, 1993,1989, 1981, 1977,1974, 1969,1900),
  out_office=c(2021, 2017, 2009, 2001,1993, 1989, 1981,1977, 1974,1969)
)

kable(presidents)
```

The first tibble I have created above is that of presidents of the United states from 1969 to date. For the fun of it, I also inclued an artifuctual president to help point out salient dimensions when working with table joins. 

### Creating tibble 2
```{r}
parties <- tibble(
  party=c("Republican", "Democratic"),
  lead=c("Ronna McDaniel", "Tom Perez")
)

kable(parties) 
```
The second tibble above shows the unique political parites in the United States and the respective party leads.

## Mutating joins:

**Joining tibbles using mutating functions:**

  1. `left_join`
  2. `right_join`
  3. `inner_join` 
  4. `full_join`


### Left Join

[<img align ="center" src="https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/left-join.gif" width="300" height="300"/>](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/left-join.gif)

**Basic syntax:** `left_join(x, y)`

**Join Function:** 

left_join(x, y): keep all x, drop unmatched y:-  Return all rows from ‘x’, and all columns from ‘x’ and ‘y’. Rows in ‘x’ with no match in ‘y’ will have ‘NA’ values in the new columns. If there are multiple matches between ‘x’ and ‘y’, all combinations of the matches are returned.

#### left_join on presidents & parties

```{r}
left_join(presidents, parties) %>% 
  kable()
```
In the table above, we see the effect of a left_join on both the `presidents` and `parties` tibbles - left and right tibbles respectively. We see that we have maintained the `presidents` tibble concartenated with an additional variable `lead` from the `parties` tibble. In this case, the party lead from the parties tibble is being matched with each row in the presidents table based on the party variable. The parties are unique in this case and since president Rebecca Asiimwe's party does not appear in the `parties` tibble, the lead is replaced with NA in the output table above. Let's try a left_join on parties and presidents.

#### left_join on parties & presidents

```{r}
left_join(parties, presidents) %>% 
  kable()
```

What happened here!! .... looks different and more interesting. When we look closely we see that Rebecca Asiimwe has been droped in this join mainly because, her party does not appear in the parties table. In a nutshell what is going on here is that the left join on (parties, presidents) maintains all variables from the parties tibble plus matching tables from the presidents table. 


### Right Join

[<img align ="center" src="https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/right-join.gif" width="300" height="300"/>](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/right-join.gif)

**Basic syntax:** `right_join(x, y)`

**Function**: keep all y, drop unmatched x:- return all rows from ‘y’, and all columns from ‘x’ and y. Rows in ‘y’ with no match in ‘x’ will have ‘NA’ values in the new columns. If there are multiple matches between ‘x’ and ‘y’, all combinations of the matches are returned

#### right_join on presidents & parties

```{r}
right_join(presidents, parties) %>% 
  kable()
```

What the right join is doing here is that it has included all the rows of of the parties tibble  and only those from the presidents tibble that match. As we can see, president Rebecca Asiimwe was droped by the right join since their party does not match any of those in the parties tibble.

### Inner Join

[<img align ="center" src="https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/inner-join.gif" width="300" height="300"/>](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/inner-join.gif)

**Basic syntax:** `inner_join(x, y)`

**Join Function:** 

inner_join(x, y): : keep only matching:- Return all rows from x where there are matching values in y, and all columns from x and y. If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combination of the matches are returned. 

#### inner_join on presidents & parties

```{r}
inner_join(presidents, parties) %>% 
  kable()
```

```{r}
inner_join(parties, presidents) %>% 
  kable()
```

We look closely we see that we get a similar result to that of a left join on parties, presidents

### Full Join

[<img align ="center" src="https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/full-join.gif" width="300" height="300"/>](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/full-join.gif)

**Basic syntax:** `full_join(x, y): keep everything`

**Join Function:** 

full_join(x, y): Return all rows and all columns from both x and y. Where there are not matching values, returns NA for the one missing. This is a mutating join.

#### full_join on presidents & parties

```{r}
full_join(presidents, parties)
```

## Filtering joins:

**Joining tibbles using filtering functions:** 

  1. `semi_join`
  2. `anti_join`

### Semi Join

[<img align ="center" src="https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/semi-join.gif" width="300" height="300"/>](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/semi-join.gif)

**Basic syntax:** `semi_join(x, y)`

**Join Function:** 

semi_join(x, y):return rows from x where there are matching values in y:- Return all rows from x where there are matching values in y, keeping just columns from x. A semi join differs from an inner join because an inner join will return one row of x for each matching row of y, where a semi join will never duplicate rows of x. This is a filtering join.


#### semi_join on presidents & parties

```{r}
semi_join(presidents, parties)
```


### Anti Join

[<img align ="center" src="https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/anti-join.gif" width="300" height="300"/>](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw04-rasiimwe/blob/master/plugins/anti-join.gif)

anti_join(x, y): Return all rows from x where there are not matching values in y, keeping just columns from x. This is a filtering join.

#### anti_join on presidents & parties

```{r}
anti_join(presidents, parties)
```

### Joining tibbles with respect to some common column name
```{r}
left_join(presidents, parties)
```

It makes sense to want to join the data frames with respect to some common column name. In this case it is clear that the id column is in both data frames. So let’s join the data frames using “id” as a “key”. The question is what to do about the fact that there is no id in df2 corresponding to id number 2. This is why different types of joins exist. Let’s see how they work. We’ll start with the left join:
So the left join looks at the first data frame df1 and then attempts to find corresponding “id” values in df2 that match all id values in df1. Of course there are no ids matching 2 or 3 in df2 so what happens ? The left join will insert NAs in the m1.y column since there are no values in df2. Note that there is in fact an id of value 3 in both data frames so it fills in both measurement columns with the values. Also note that since in both data frames there is a column named “m1” so it has to create unique names to accommodate both columns. The “x” and “y” come from the fact that df1 comes before df2 in the calling sequence to left_join. Thus “x” matches df1 and “y” matches df2.

## Set Operations:

**Functions used for set operations on two tibbles:**

  1. `intersect`
  2. `union`
  3. `setdiff`



## Biding datasets:

  1. `bind_rows` 
  2. `bind cols`

```{r}
#bind_rows
```

```{r}
#bind_cols
```
