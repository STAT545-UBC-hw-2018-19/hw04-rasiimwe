# STAT545A Homework 4 Repository of Rebecca Asiimwe 

## Theme: Tidy data and joins

### Assignment overview
On many occasions, the data we recieve as analysts and researchers comes in formats that may not allow for easy data analysis. In this assignment, we shall go over deeper aspects of data wrangling by working with aggregation and data reshaping.
to put our data in shapes that best fit and support the data analysis tasks at hand. Here, I will go over functions such as gather() and spread() from tidyr to reshape data and use join functions to combine two datasets from whcih combined inferances will be made. 

To my awesome guests to my repo, below is a table that will walk you though my homework build up and a brief description of the R elemets adderessed ine each.
