<p align=justify>On many occasions, the data we recieve as analysts and researchers comes in formats that may not allow for easy data analysis. In this assignment, we shall go over deeper aspects of data wrangling by working with aggregation and data reshaping.
to put our data in shapes that best fit and support the data analysis tasks at hand. Here, I will go over functions such as gather() and spread() from tidyr to reshape data and use join functions to combine two datasets from whcih combined inferances will be made. </p>


To my awesome guests to my repo, please visit [howework1](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw01-rasiimwe) and [howework2](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw02-rasiimwe/blob/master/hw02.md) for a background on the gapminder dataset. In here I show the exploration, manipulation and analysis of the gapminder dataset. [homework3](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw03-rasiimwe/blob/master/hw03-rasiimwe.md) will walk you over concepts needed for  data manipulation, exploration and visualization of the gapminder dataset using dplyr and the applocation of ggplot2 to accomplish data manipulation and visualization tasks respectively.
